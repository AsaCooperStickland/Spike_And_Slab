# Spike and Slab model 

Python code for my masters project. I've got a dataset of peptoids (a peptide mimicking molecule), and how effective they are against a range of different 
microbes. I'm using linear regression with sparsity-inducing priors (spike and slab ones to be precise) to figure out which features of the peptoids make them
good drugs. 

# Toy Dataset

I'm not putting the real dataset on Github since it's not mine! But we can demonstrate the principal using a toy dataset.
